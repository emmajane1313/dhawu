    "texto": "Now we enter the space of possibility. So far, we’ve looked at things that are, were, and will be. Now let’s look at what might happen, what should happen, what must happen. And what should have or would have happened, but didn't.<br/><br/>These ideas are all part of what's called the modal system — the grammar of uncertainty, intent, obligation and potential. In English, we use words like might, would, should, must.<br/><br/>In Gupapuyŋu, these ideas are just as present — but built into the verbs themselves through specific suffixes and particles.<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>Possibility in the future — “might”:</span><br/>To say that something might happen, we usually take the secondary form of the verb and add balaŋu.<br/>Ŋayi balaŋu dhiŋguŋu → She might die<br/>Ŋarra balaŋu rirrikthurru → I might get sick<br/><br/>You can also use balaŋu with yurru or dhu and the primary form of the verb, especially if you're emphasising the subject or formality:<br/>Nhe yurru rirrikthun balaŋu → You might get sick<br/>Ŋali dhu balaŋu dhiŋgama → We might break it<br/><br/>If you want to express that someone might be doing something or might not be doing it (continuous nature), you use secondary form + balaŋu gi bäna<br/>Ŋayi balaŋu gi bäna yaka ŋayathulu djurra'  → She might not have a book<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>Possibility in the past — “might have”:</span><br/>To say something might have happened, we use the quaternary form of the verb with bäna balaŋu:<br/>Ŋayi bäna balaŋu djaw'yuna → He might have taken them<br/>Walala bäna balaŋu marrtjinya Gaṯtjilili → They might have gone to Gaṯtjilili<br/>Nhe bäna balaŋu bakthuna → You might have got hurt<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>Obligation or expectation — “should / would”:</span><br/>Now we shift from possibility to what should or would happen.<br/>There are three common structures:<br/>Secondary form + balaŋu<br/>Ŋuli + secondary form<br/>Balaŋu ŋuli + secondary form<br/><br/>If you want to express continuous action, add gi.<br/><br/>Nhe gi balaŋu guŋga'yurru ŋanya → You should help him<br/>Ŋarra balaŋu marŋgikuŋu ŋanya → I should teach him<br/>Ŋarra ŋuli marŋgikuŋu ŋanya → I should teach him<br/>Nhe balaŋu ŋuli gi ŋanya guŋga'yurru → You should be helping him<br/><br/>All of these express obligation, but the tone and context define the strength — some more like a suggestion, others more like an expectation.<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>“Would have / should have” – in the past:</span><br/>For the past, we return to the quaternary form + balaŋu.<br/>Balaŋu walala ḏitjilili marrtjinya → They should have gone to the bush<br/>Ŋanapurru balaŋu roŋiyinya → We should have returned<br/><br/>👉 The tone of voice does the heavy lifting here. Just like in English, where 'you should have come' vs 'you would have come?' differ more in intonation than structure.<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>Necessity — “must”:</span><br/>To say someone must do something (or must not), use the secondary form of the verb with ŋuli:<br/>Nhe ŋuli (gi) yaka ŋanya waŋi → You must not talk to him<br/><br/>For stronger emphasis, switch to the primary form + yurru, which expresses obligation in the future:<br/>Nhe yurru yaka ŋanya waŋa → You really mustn’t talk to him"
