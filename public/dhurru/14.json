    "texto": "Now let's cover the infinitive — this is going to be very useful, because it opens the door to expressing longer, more complex thoughts. We're stepping beyond direct commands or isolated events, into the realm of planning, motivation, and evaluation.<br/><br/>In English, the infinitive uses 'to' before the verb: 'to eat', 'to work', 'to drink'. It typically follows another verb — like in 'I want to go', 'She came to see', or 'We tried to run'. It also follows adjectives when expressing something suggested or suitable: 'This is good to eat', 'It's light to carry.'<br/><br/>In Gupapuyŋu, we form the infinitive by taking the quaternary form of the verb and adding the suffix -wa. Only the second verb (the infinitive) carries this suffix. The first verb is conjugated normally based on tense. And if a noun follows the infinitive, that noun also takes a suffix to match — either -wa, -ku, -gu, or -wu, depending on how it ends.<br/><br/>Ŋarra gorana ḻakaranharawa → I was ashamed to tell.<br/>Nhe moŋala ḻupthunarawa → You forgot to wash.<br/>Ŋayi nhuna waŋana rrupiyawa bothurruwa → He told you to count the money.<br/>Dhuwala guya manymak ḻukanharawa → This fish is good to eat.<br/>Dhuwala yiki djinbulk mitthunarawa → This knife is sharp enough to cut.<br/><br/>Note that the direct object follows the same rules as in Lesson 5.<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>1. If the direct object ends in a vowel or vowel and glottal stop (a, i, u or a’, i’, u’) you add –wa or -wu to the end:</span><br/>Ŋarra nhuna waŋana gurthawa dhaŋalkunharawa -> I told you to light a fire<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>2. If the direct object ends in a stop consonant (p, t, ṯ, tj, k, ’) you add –ku:</span><br/>Ŋarra nhuna waŋana miyalkku guŋga'yunarawa -> I told you to help the woman<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>3. If the direct object ends in a nasal, liquid or glide (m, n, ṉ, ny, ŋ, l, ḻ, r, rr, y, w) you add –gu:</span><br/>Ŋayi nhuna waŋana dhukungu djalkthunarawa -> He told you to throw away the rubbish<br/><br/>Note that with verbs like 'to try' or 'to start', when they’re conjugated and come first, the infinitive that follows does not carry the -wa suffix:<br/>Ŋarra birrka'yurruna bathara → I tried to cook it.<br/>Ŋarra ŋurru-djirr'yurruna ḻupthurruna → I started to wash it."
