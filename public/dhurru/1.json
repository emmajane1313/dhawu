Take a look:<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>Singular — One person:</span><br/>Ŋarra → I / Me <br/>Nhe → You <br/>Ŋayi → He / She <br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>Dual — Two people:</span><br/>Ŋali → You and I<br/>Ŋilingu → She / He and I<br/>Nhuma → You Two<br/>Maṉda → Those Two<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>Plural — Three people:</span><br/>Ŋilimurru → I + You All<br/>Ŋanapurru → I + They / Them<br/>Nhuma → You All<br/>Walala → They / Them<br/><br/><br/>Did you see that? With just one word, you can express who you're talking about, how many people are involved, and whether the listener is included or not.<br/><br/>No extra padding. No wasted breath. Imagine moving across harsh terrain, among snakes, spiders, crocodiles, and spirits older than memory. You don’t have time for long explanations. You need one word and it has to hit with knife-edge precision.<br/><br/>And here's something striking: Gupapuyŋu, like Arabic and Ancient Greek, has a dual form. Not singular, not plural — exactly two. Two people isn’t just a number. It’s a witness and a storyteller. Grammar doesn’t add that by accident."
