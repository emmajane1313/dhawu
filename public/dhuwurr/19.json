And a quick one — just to add a little more perspective.<br/><br/>If you’ve spent some time looking through the <a style='cursor: url('https://thedial.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbR22PYokrESYeCtwrwpETsby8q959zVNJgSv1x136yiQ'), auto;' href='https://dhawu.emancipa.xyz/wukirri/djama/'>verb dictionary</a>, you might have noticed something about Group 5 verbs. They often end in 'yun or 'thun — and Group 5 is actually the largest group of verbs in the language. But here’s where it gets interesting:<br/>Very often, the word before the 'yun / 'thun ending is itself a noun. And adding 'yun / 'thun transforms that noun into a verb — into an action.<br/><br/>In other words: the language is doing what we saw back in Lesson 16 with compound images — building action out of concept.<br/><br/>Look at this:<br/>yaka → no<br/>yaka’yun → to say no / to refuse<br/><br/>Beautiful, right? You’ll see this throughout the dictionary.<br/><br/>And once you start to feel this pattern, it gives you more clarity — and more freedom. When you see a 'yun / 'thun verb, you’ll be able to break it apart mentally — and understand it more deeply. And sometimes, you may even find yourself able to create new verbs intuitively — because the system is so natural.<br/><br/>And note that we:<br/>Use -thun after nasal sounds → (m, n, ṉ, ny, ŋ)<br/>Use -yun after everything else.<br/><br/>Let’s look at some examples:<br/>gumurr → chest → gumurr’yun → to meet (literally chest to chest)<br/>munha → night → munha’yun → to become night / to be night<br/>dhä → mouth → dhä’yun → to open one’s mouth<br/>ḏutji → firestick → ḏutji’yun → to make fire<br/>bondi → quickly → bondi’yun → to move quickly / to hurry<br/>bala → movement away from the speaker → bala’yun → to move away<br/>räli → movement towards the speaker → räli’yun → to walk forward<br/><br/>And here’s another lively detail:<br/>Sometimes, when we remove 'yun / 'thun from these verbs, and double the word, we produce an adjective — usually describing state.<br/><br/>Look:<br/>ḻapthun → to open → ḻapḻap → open<br/>bakthun → to break → bakpak → broken<br/>ḏaw’yun → to break → ḏaw’taw → broken<br/>ḏapthun → to clench → ḏapṯap → clenched<br/><br/>Now — you might have noticed: sometimes, when the word is doubled, the letter changes. Why?<br/><br/>It’s not random. It follows a sound pattern. If the word ends with a voiceless stop (p, t, ṯ, tj, k, '), the following letter shifts when doubled.<br/><br/>And — guess what? There’s another fascinating parallel here to Japanese!<br/><br/>In Japanese, when you form certain plurals or repetitive forms by doubling words — the same kind of consonant change often happens. This system is called rendaku (連濁) in Japanese, and it usually occurs when the first consonant of the second word in a compound shifts — typically from a voiceless stop to its voiced counterpart.<br/><br/>人 (hito → person) → 人々 (hitobito → people)<br/>時 (toki → time) → 時々 (tokidoki → sometimes)<br/>山 (yama → mountain) → 山々 (yamayama → mountains)<br/>国 (kuni → country) → 国々 (kuniguni → countries)<br/><br/>It’s fascinating, right? The patterns are everywhere."
