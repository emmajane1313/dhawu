And a quick one, just to add a little more perspective.<br/><br/>If you’ve spent some time looking through the <a style='cursor: url('https://thedial.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbR22PYokrESYeCtwrwpETsby8q959zVNJgSv1x136yiQ'), auto;' href='https://dhawu.emancipa.xyz/wukirri/djama/'>verb dictionary</a>, you might have noticed something about Group 5 verbs. They often end in 'yun or 'thun, and Group 5 is actually the largest group of verbs in the language. But here’s where it gets interesting:<br/>Very often, the word before the 'yun / 'thun ending is itself a noun. And adding 'yun / 'thun transforms that noun into a verb, into an action.<br/><br/>In other words: the language is doing what we saw back in Lesson 16 with compound images, building action out of concept.<br/><br/>Look at this:<br/>yaka → no<br/>yaka’yun → to say no / to refuse<br/><br/>Beautiful, right? You’ll see this throughout the dictionary.<br/><br/>And once you start to feel this pattern, it gives you more clarity, and more freedom. When you see a 'yun / 'thun verb, you’ll be able to break it apart mentally, and understand it more deeply. And sometimes, you may even find yourself able to create new verbs intuitively, because the system is so natural.<br/><br/>And note that we:<br/>Use -thun after nasal sounds → (m, n, ṉ, ny, ŋ)<br/>Use -yun after everything else.<br/><br/>Let’s look at some examples:<br/>gumurr → chest → gumurr’yun → to meet (literally chest to chest)<br/>munha → night → munha’yun → to become night / to be night<br/>dhä → mouth → dhä’yun → to open one’s mouth<br/>ḏutji → firestick → ḏutji’yun → to make fire<br/>bondi → quickly → bondi’yun → to move quickly / to hurry<br/>bala → movement away from the speaker → bala’yun → to move away<br/>räli → movement towards the speaker → räli’yun → to walk forward<br/><br/>And here’s another lively detail:<br/>Sometimes, when we remove 'yun / 'thun from these verbs, and double the word, we produce an adjective, usually describing state.<br/><br/>Look:<br/>ḻapthun → to open → ḻapḻap → open<br/>bakthun → to break → bakpak → broken<br/>ḏaw’yun → to break → ḏaw’taw → broken<br/>ḏapthun → to clench → ḏapṯap → clenched<br/><br/>Now, you might have noticed: sometimes, when the word is doubled, the letter changes. Why?<br/><br/>It’s not random. It follows a sound pattern. If the word ends with a voiceless stop (p, t, ṯ, tj, k, '), the following letter shifts when doubled.<br/><br/>And, guess what? There’s another fascinating parallel here to Japanese!<br/><br/>In Japanese, when you form certain plurals or repetitive forms by doubling words, the same kind of consonant change often happens. This system is called rendaku (連濁) in Japanese, and it usually occurs when the first consonant of the second word in a compound shifts, typically from a voiceless stop to its voiced counterpart.<br/><br/>人 (hito → person) → 人々 (hitobito → people)<br/>時 (toki → time) → 時々 (tokidoki → sometimes)<br/>山 (yama → mountain) → 山々 (yamayama → mountains)<br/>国 (kuni → country) → 国々 (kuniguni → countries)<br/><br/>It’s fascinating, right? The patterns are everywhere."
