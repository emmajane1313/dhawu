When you eventually (hopefully 😉) start learning Hebrew, and this is also the case in Arabic (but let’s focus on Hebrew for now), something fascinating happens as you start working through the verb groups. Because of the way these groups are structured, and the logic behind them, you begin to notice and think about English verbs a little differently too.<br/><br/>You start seeing the underlying logic, the old patterns, of how language and verbs were probably developed. Let’s take an example:<br/>The verb לִכְתּוֹב (likhtov) → to write<br/>This is something that happens, someone writes. The verb is fairly neutral or passive.<br/><br/>But now think about the word scribe in English. But now think about the verb לְהַכְתִּיב (lehakhtiv) → to dictate.<br/><br/>Now you are not writing, you are making writing happen. You are causing someone else to write. And here’s where it clicks: in Hebrew, this is done by moving the verb into a different causative group, exactly the same logical shift. You go from doing → to causing to do. You’d change its form to a causative pattern.<br/><br/>Another even clearer example:<br/>רָאָה (ra’ah) → to see<br/>הֵרְאָה (her’ah) → to cause to see → to show<br/><br/>Again, think about the nuance here: When you show something, you are making it seen. There is force or intention behind the action.<br/><br/>Now, here’s why we’re talking about this in Gupapuyŋu: we can do something very similar here.<br/><br/>In Gupapuyŋu, we can turn certain intransitive verbs into transitive verbs, we can add that same sense of force / cause / make, by adding the suffix -marama to the quaternary form of the verb. When we do this, the verb shifts into a 7th group pattern of behaviour.<br/><br/>Let’s look at some examples:<br/>Djäwa gärri → Djäwa went in.<br/>Djäwa ŋanya gärrinyamarama → Djäwa made/let him go in.<br/><br/>Nhina → to sit → intransitive<br/>Nhinanhamarama → to make sit → transitive<br/><br/>Balimaŋ nhinana → Balimaŋ sat down.<br/>Balimaŋ walalanha nhinanhamaraŋala → Balimaŋ made them sit down.<br/><br/>Mukthurru → to become quiet → intransitive<br/>Mukmaraŋala → to make quiet → transitive<br/><br/>Lorru mukthurruna → Lorru became quiet.<br/>Lorru ŋanya mukmaraŋala → Lorru made him quiet.<br/><br/>Tractor bakthurruna → The tractor broke.<br/>Raymandhu tractor Bakmaraŋala → Rayman broke the tractor.<br/><br/>Ḻithan → to get dry/warm → intransitive<br/>Ḻithanmarama → to make dry → transitive<br/><br/>Ŋarra yurru ḻithan → I will get dry / warm.<br/>Girri' ŋarra yurru ḻithanmarama → I will make the clothes dry / dry the clothes.<br/><br/>Roŋiyirri → to return (oneself) → intransitive<br/>Roŋanmaraŋala → to return something → transitive<br/><br/>Bäya roŋiyirri → Bäya returned (himself).<br/>Bäyay djurra' roŋanmaraŋala → Bäya returned the book.<br/><br/>Important notes:<br/>You cannot always simply take any intransitive verb and force it into a transitive form by adding -marama.<br/>Not every verb allows this shift. If you’re unsure, check the dictionary <a style='cursor: url('https://thedial.infura-ipfs.io/ipfs/QmbR22PYokrESYeCtwrwpETsby8q959zVNJgSv1x136yiQ'), auto;' href='https://dhawu.emancipa.xyz/wukirri/djama/'>here</a>.<br/>Also, sometimes you’ll see, as marked in the dictionary, that the same verb form is used for both transitive and intransitive meanings, depending on context."
