The action happens, but no one and nothing is receiving it.<br><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>Intransitive Verb:</span><br/>The subject → takes no suffix (This is why you’ve seen ŋarra, nhe, ŋayi used bare with intransitive verbs.)<br/><br/>If there is a noun or expression showing with what / by what the action is happening (like an instrument, tool, or manner), then gu / ku / wu / wa is used on that noun — as we saw in Lesson 11.<br/><br/>Example:<br/>Stephen marrtjina → Stephen went<br/>(no suffix needed — no one is being acted upon)"
