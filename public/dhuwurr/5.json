    "texto": "Okay, one more lesson on possession, then we move on. Promise.<br/><br/>In Lesson 3, we learned how to say things like “This is my fish.” But what if the fish doesn’t belong to me, you, or her? What if it belongs to Bazza? Or Shazza? Or a woman? Or a place?<br/><br/> Now we’re talking about possessive nouns, and yes, Gupapuyŋu handles this with a suffix too.  Kind of like English and its trusty little ’s, Stephen’s fish, the woman’s home, my brother’s dog. We don’t think of that “’s” as a suffix, but really… it is. It marks who owns what.<br/><br/>And here's where Gupapuyŋu gets clever. English fumbles a bit when things get messy, like when a word ends in s, and we’re stuck wondering: Is it Chris's or Chris’? Is that the boss's chair or the boss’ chair? The rhythm gets clunky.<br/><br/>Gupapuyŋu fixes that gracefully. Because Gupapuyŋu is deeply attuned to sound. The suffixes change based on how the word ends, so that things flow naturally. No awkward breaks or stumbling. Just clean, elegant grammar in motion.<br/><br/>So how does it work?<br/>Depending on the final sound of the noun (the possessor), Gupapuyŋu uses three main suffixes to mark possession:<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>1. If the noun ends in a vowel or vowel and glottal stop (a, i, u or a’, i’, u’) you add –wa to the end:</span><br/>Dhuwala guya Djäwawa → This is Djäwa’s fish<br/>(Note: sometimes –wu appears instead of –wa, depending on dialect or flow)<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>2. If the noun ends in a stop consonant (p, t, ṯ, tj, k, ’) you add –ku:</span><br/>Guya dhuwala miyalkku → This is the woman’s fish<br/><br/><span style='font-size: 17px; color: #ffff00'>3. If the noun ends in a nasal, liquid or glide (m, n, ṉ, ny, ŋ, l, ḻ, r, rr, y, w) you add –gu:</span><br/>Dhuwala guya Stephengu → This is Stephen’s fish<br/><br/>Speaking Gupapuyŋu means speaking smoothly, responsively, musically. It’s grammar built for the ear, not just the page. And side note, we also add these suffixes to the personal pronouns like changing Ŋarra to Ŋarraku (with suffix ku after vowel a). But there is also a few other internal changes that you would have noticed in Lesson 3, because those states are special 😉."
