    "texto": "When expressing states in the present tense using adjectives (like good, hungry, tired), there is no equivalent of the English verb 'to be'. Instead of saying 'this is good' or 'they are tired', you simply place a demonstrative (like this or that) directly before the adjective — with no verb in between.<br/><br/>To be more clear, forms like 'I am', 'you are', 'she is', 'we are', 'they are', don’t exist when describing states or qualities. There’s no 'am', 'are', 'is' — no filler, no fluff.<br/><br/>So, the structure becomes:<br/>[this/that/personal pronoun] + [adjective]<br/>e.g. this good, they hungry, that tired.<br/><br/>The language moves straight to the essence: clean, direct, understood.<br/>Does this feel strange to you?<br/><br/>It shouldn’t!<br/><br/>Languages like Arabic, Hebrew, Ukrainian, Japonese, Turkish… all of them drop the verb 'to be' in the present tense when describing states or qualities. It’s not some exotic quirk — it’s a common, elegant strategy.<br/><br/>Gupapuyŋu stands alongside these languages that cut to the core of meaning. No need to pad the truth with grammar that doesn’t serve it. You don’t need to say “is” to express that something is.<br/><br/>Step outside the structure of English. This is how language breathes elsewhere.<br/><br/>Note also that the word order is not fixed, you have flexibility to change up the order of words in almost all frases in Gupapuyŋu.<br/><br/>- Dhuwala manymak (This is good)<br/>- Dhuwali yätjkurru (That is bad)<br/>- Ŋarra yindi (I am big)<br/>- Dhuwala gorrmur' (This is hot)<br/>- Weyin dhuwala (This is long/tall)<br/>- Dharrpi dhuwali (That is crooked)<br/>- Ŋali ŋäthiliŋu (We (you and I) are old)<br/>- Ŋali ŋäthiliŋu (We (you and I) are old)<br/><br/>This same structure works when you are describing something/someone specific. We just add that noun... in any order!<br/><br/>- Dhuwala gara weyin (This spear is long)<br/>- Dhuwali miyalk gurrir (That girl/woman is short)<br/>- Guya yindi dhuwali (That fish is big)<br/>- Yindi Dharpa (The tree is big)<br/>- Yothu nyumukuṉiny (The baby is small)"
